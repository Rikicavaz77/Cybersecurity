1) The program functions as a sort of database.
2) By entering a number from 1 to 151, the program displays information about the Pok√©mon associated with that number.
3) I analyze the readable character sequences (ASCII or Unicode text strings) contained within the binary file.

strings ./honeydex

4) I notice that there are some strings starting with "TIP" that provide hints about the challenge.
5) I filter the search further:

strings ./honeydex | grep "TIP"
Finding SPRITZ{FLAG} with strings would be too easy, but you are very close! Read all the TIPs!
TIP: TAs told you the FLAG FORMAT... but maybe it's not displayed in that way!
TIP: Really need a MIRROR?
TIP: If aperol + prosecco + water is wrong...
TIP: ... why not try water + prosecco + aperol?

6) The highlighted strings suggest that the flag has been reversed.
7) I attempt to filter the search using the keyword "ZTIRPS":

strings ./honeydex | grep "ZTIRPS"

8) I obtain the reversed flag:

}803998_ekoPWOOOOOLS_ereh_yllaniF{ZTIRPS

9) I write a Python script to execute the previous steps and reverse the flag.

Flag: SPRITZ{Finally_here_SLOOOOOWPoke_899308}
