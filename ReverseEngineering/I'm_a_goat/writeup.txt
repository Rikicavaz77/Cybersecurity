1) The program asks for two inputs:

unsigned int address;
unsigned int value;
scanf("%x", &address);
scanf("%x", &value);

2) The two inputs must be in hexadecimal format.
3) The flag is printed in the win function, but this function is never called in the main.
4) I can overwrite an entry in the GOT (Global Offset Table) to redirect execution to the win function instead of the exit function.
5) The first input must be the address of the GOT entry to overwrite.
6) The second input must be the address of the win function.
7) The address variable will be cast into a pointer to an unsigned integer, and through dereferencing, the GOT entry will be overwritten, replacing the address of the exit function with the address of the win function.
8) I write a Python script to overwrite the GOT entry and obtain the flag.

Flag: spritz{GOT_not_Goat!}
