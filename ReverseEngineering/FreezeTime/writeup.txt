1) The program requires pressing the Enter key twice to steal and destroy the Diamond containing a secret (probably the flag).
2) Once the message is retrieved, the program pauses for a moment and then terminates without printing the flag.
3) The flag must be captured before the program ends and the message is lost.

call    extract_message
mov     [rbp+var_8], rax

4) I launch gdb to debug the program, but when executing the run command, I receive a suspicious warning and the program terminates.
5) The is_policeman_here function seems to block the use of gdb.
6) I modify the is_policeman_here function by replacing the conditional jump (jz) with an unconditional jump (jmp) and patch the program.
7) I set a breakpoint at the instruction right after the call to the extract_message function:

break *0x0000000000402121

8) I check the contents of the rax register:

x /s $rax
0x408410 <msg>: "SPRITZ{Za_WaRuDo_348178}"

9) I type 'continue' to finish running the program.

Flag: SPRITZ{Za_WaRuDo_348178}
