1) After entering a character other than 'n', the program prompts for the input of a string.
2) I replace the conditional jump jz with an unconditional jump jmp, allowing the program to accept any input.
3) Next, the program prompts for a number.
4) Since the number is generated randomly, I again replace the conditional jump jz with an unconditional jump jmp, so the program accepts any input.
5) A loop then executes, printing a series of messages on the screen:

  for (local_c4 = 0; local_c4 < 0x96; local_c4 = local_c4 + 1) {
    puts("Nice ");
    sleep(1);
  }

6) This loop waits for 150 seconds without performing any useful operations to obtain the flag.
7) Therefore, I replace the conditional jump jle with nop (opcode 90).
8) The same applies to the following loop:

  for (local_c4 = 0; local_c4 < 0x96; local_c4 = local_c4 + 1) {
    puts("...");
    sleep(1);
  }

9) I replace the conditional jump jle with nop (opcode 90).
10) I execute the program and obtain the flag.
