1) By analyzing the content of the file, I notice it is an ELF file (Executable and Linkable Format), a standard file format for executables.
2) I run the command ls -l ./PiovegoRecipe to view the file's permissions.
3) Since the x (execute) permission is missing, I run the command chmod +x ./PiovegoRecipe to make the file executable as a program or script.
4) I execute the file using the command ./PiovegoRecipe to start the program.
5) I use IDA (Interactive Disassembler) to convert the executable code into assembly language.

First Input:
1) A comparison is made between two strings: s2 ("Patate-Prezzemolate") and s1 (the input string).
2) The two strings must be identical, so I input "Patate-Prezzemolate".

Second Input:
1) The function check_quantities is called.
2) The input number is doubled, and the result is added to the original value.
3) The final result must be equal to 0A8h (168 in decimal).
4) I need to input a number such that 168 = x * 2 + x.
5) I calculate input 168 / 3 = 56 and input 56.

Third Input:
1) The input number must be equal to 7Bh (123 in decimal).
2) I input 123.

Final Input:
1) The function check_secret is called.
2) The length of the string must be equal to 5.
3) Character-by-character comparisons are performed.
4) Strings are represented as arrays of characters.
5) The indices to access are determined by the variables s, var_1F, var_1E, var_1D, and var_1C (the first character is at [rbp+s], the second at [rbp+var_1F], and so on).
6) Based on the comparisons made for each index, I derive the following string:

53h ; 'S'
77h ; 'w'
65h ; 'e'
34h ; '4'
54h ; 'T'

7) I input the string "Swe4T" and obtain the flag.

Flag: SPRITZ{D15gUsT!nG!!}
