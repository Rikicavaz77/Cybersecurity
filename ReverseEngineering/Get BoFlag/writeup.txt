1. I use Hex-Rays to decompile the binary:

  char v4[79];
  char s1[8];
  char v6[8];
  char v7;

  v7 = 78;
  setvbuf(_bss_start, 0LL, 2, 0LL);
  puts("Do you want the flag?");
  gets(v4);
  if ( v7 != 89 )
  {
    puts("You didn't want it bad enough!\nBye!");
    exit(0);
  }
  if ( memcmp(s1, "DEADBEEF", 8uLL) )
  {
    puts("You didn't want it bad enough!\nBye!");
    exit(0);
  }
  if ( !memcmp(v6, "CAFEBABE", 8uLL) )
  {
    puts("Nice, you want it!");
    print_flag();
    putchar(10);
  }

2. The input string is stored in v4.
3. The first comparison is made with the variable v7, which initially contains the value 'N'.
4. I need to replace this value with 'Y'.
5. The variable s1 must contain the string "DEADBEEF".
6. The variable v6 must contain the string "CAFEBABE".
7. I can perform a buffer overflow.
8. I input 79 'A' characters to fill the buffer.
9. Then, I input a sequence of 17 additional characters:

s1[8] -> "DEADBEEF"
v6[8] -> "CAFEBABE"
v7    -> 'Y'

10. I write a Python script to automate these operations and obtain the flag.

Flag: spritz{b0f_ch4ng3S_v4riabl3s_xdxd}
