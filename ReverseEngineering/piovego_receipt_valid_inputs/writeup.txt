IDA

1) By analyzing the content of the file, I notice it is an ELF file (Executable and Linkable Format), a standard file format for executables.
2) I run the command ls -l ./PiovegoRecipe to view the file's permissions.
3) Since the x (execute) permission is missing, I run the command chmod +x ./PiovegoRecipe to make the file executable as a program or script.
4) I execute the file using the command ./PiovegoRecipe to start the program.
5) I use IDA (Interactive Disassembler) to convert the executable code into assembly language.

First Input:
1) A comparison is made between two strings: s2 ("Patate-Prezzemolate") and s1 (the input string).
2) The two strings must be identical, so I input "Patate-Prezzemolate".

Second Input:
1) The function check_quantities is called.
2) The input number is doubled, and the result is added to the original value.
3) The final result must be equal to 0A8h (168 in decimal).
4) I need to input a number such that 168 = x * 2 + x.
5) I calculate 168 / 3 = 56 and input 56.

Third Input:
1) The input number must be equal to 7Bh (123 in decimal).
2) I input 123.

Final Input:
1) The function check_secret is called.
2) The length of the string must be equal to 5.
3) Character-by-character comparisons are performed.
4) Strings are represented as arrays of characters.
5) The indices to access are determined by the variables s, var_1F, var_1E, var_1D and var_1C (the first character is at [rbp+s], the second at [rbp+var_1F], and so on).
6) Based on the comparisons made for each index, I derive the following string:

53h ; 'S'
77h ; 'w'
65h ; 'e'
34h ; '4'
54h ; 'T'

7) I input the string "Swe4T" and obtain the flag.

Ghidra

1) I execute the file using the command ./PiovegoRecipe to start the program.
2) I use Ghidra to analyze and disassemble the executable file.

First Input:

Main:	
  char local_48 [32];
  __isoc99_scanf(&DAT_0040226e,local_48);
  iVar1 = strcmp(local_48,"Patate-Prezzemolate");
  if (iVar1 != 0) {
    exit(0);
  }
  printf("\nGreat! Now let\'s see if you know how to prepare them :)");

1) The variable local_48 holds the string entered as input.
2) local_48 must be equal to "Patate-Prezzemolate".
3) Therefore, I input "Patate-Prezzemolate".

Second and Third Input:

Main:
  iVar1 = check_quantities();
  if (iVar1 == 0) {
    exit(0);
  }
  puts("Wow, it seems you have studied!! :)");

check_quantities:
  printf("\nHow many potatoes do you need for 100 people? ");
  __isoc99_scanf(&DAT_004022a8,&local_18);
  if (local_18 * 3 == 0xa8) {
    printf("\nGood, and how much parsley? ");
    __isoc99_scanf(&DAT_004022a8,&local_14);
    if (local_14 == 0x7b) {
      uVar1 = 1;
    }
  }
  return uVar1;

Second Input:

1) The function check_quantities is called.
2) The triple of the input number must be equal to 0xa8 (168 in decimal).
3) I calculate 168 / 3 = 56 and input 56.

Third Input:

1) The input number must be equal to 0x7b (123 in decimal).
2) I input 123.

Final Input:

Main:
  char local_28;
  char local_27;
  char local_26;
  char local_25;
  char local_24;
  iVar1 = check_secret();
  if (iVar1 == 0) {
    exit(0);
  }
  puts("Yes YeS YESS! Sweat and hard work are the ingredients for success!! Welcome on board!!!")

check_secret:
  printf("\nWhat is the super iper mega special and secret ingredient?? ");
  __isoc99_scanf(&DAT_0040226e,&local_28);
  sVar1 = strlen(&local_28);
  if (sVar1 == 5) {
    if (local_28 == 'S') {
      if (local_26 == 'e') {
        if (local_24 == 'T') {
          if (local_27 == 'w') {
            if (local_25 == '4') {
              uVar2 = 1;
            }
  return uVar2;

1) The function check_secret is called.
2) The length of the string must be equal to 5.
3) DAT_0040226e is a format string (%s), so scanf expects a string of characters as input.
4) Since local_28 is a char variable, &local_28 means that scanf will read the entered string and store it starting from the address of local_28.
5) Therefore, each variable, starting from local_28, will contain a character from the string.
6) I input the string "Swe4T" and obtain the flag.
