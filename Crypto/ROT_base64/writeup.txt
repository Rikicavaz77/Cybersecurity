I perform the encrypting operation in reverse.

1) First, I implement an algorithm for the rotation cipher.
2) The provided code includes two variables, ALPHABET and LEN, which give me information about the alphabet used during encryption and its length.
3) To perform the shift, I need to find the index of each character within ALPHABET. I subtract the shift value from this index. The result is then taken modulo LEN to ensure the rotation wraps correctly.
4) The resulting text is in Base64 format, as its length is a multiple of 4.
5) I decode the text from Base64 and retrieve the flag.
