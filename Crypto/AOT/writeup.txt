1) I notice that the encrypted text contains some random-looking data, so it is likely encoded using a repeating key XOR.
2) Analyzing the code, I observe that XOR is performed between each character of the plaintext and a variable x1.
3) The variable x1 is a number that must be different from x2, x3, and the sum of x2 and x3.
4) Additionally, the modulo of x1 with 731 must be equal to the modulo of x1 + x2 with 731.
5) The goal is to identify the value of x1 used for the encoding.
6) The values of x1 and x2 are not critical for decoding but are necessary to satisfy the constraints.
7) I know that x1 > 0, since XORing a character with 0 returns the same character.
8) Therefore, I set x2 = 0, ensuring it is always different from x1. With this, the conditions x1 != (x2 + x3) and f(x1) == f(x2 + x3) simplify to x1 != x3 and f(x1) == f(x3).
9) By analyzing the characters in the encrypted text and making assumptions about the plaintext, I can infer that a number between 1 and 127 (ASCII table) was used for the XOR during encoding. This assumption reduces the search space for the brute-force attack.
10) I set x3 = x1 + 731. This ensures that the modulo with 731 is the same for both.
11) To optimize the search, I leverage the fact that part of the plaintext is known, as I know the format of the flag.
12) If during an iteration the resulting text contains the string "spritzCTF{", then I have found the original message and can terminate the algorithm.
13) With x1 equal to 70, I obtain the flag.

Flag: spritzCTF{sasageyo}
