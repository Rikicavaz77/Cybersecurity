1) I notice that the string consists of only two characters: "Z" and "O".
2) I replace "Z" with "0" and "O" with "1", in order to obtain a binary string.
3) I convert the string from binary to ASCII.
4) The resulting text ends with ==, which makes me think it is base64 encoding.
5) I check the length of the text.
6) The length is a multiple of 4, so I can assume this is base64 encoding.
7) The alphabet used also matches.
8) Analyzing the resulting text, I can assume that a substitution cipher was used.
9) Therefore, the technique I can apply is cryptanalysis.
10) I calculate the frequency of each character in the encrypted text.
11) The obtained values can be compared to the frequency of characters in the English language. 
12) This way, every time I perform a substitution to recover the plaintext message, I can check that the frequency between the two characters is not too far apart.
13) Another strategy I can apply is calculating the frequency of character sequences in the encrypted text.
14) This allows me to identify correlations with common terms in the English language. 15) For example, a sequence like X'Y in the encrypted text could refer to I'M in the plaintext. Similarly, a sequence like XYZ that appears 15 times could correspond to the word THE.
16) With each substitution, I update this list to aid in identifying known terms and keep track of how many characters still need to be substituted.
17) The resulting text contains the flag.
