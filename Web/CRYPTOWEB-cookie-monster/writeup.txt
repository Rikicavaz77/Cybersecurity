1) "Inspect" --> "Application" --> "Cookies".
2) I notice that the permission field is associated with the following value:

04f8996da763b7a969b1028ee3007569eaf3a635486ddab211d512c85b9df8fb

3) I use an online cracker and find that this is a SHA-256 encoded hash.
4) The plaintext value is "user".
5) I need to access the site as "admin".
6) Therefore, I encode the string "admin" in SHA-256 and obtain the following value:

8c6976e5b5410415bde908bd4dee15dfb167a9c873fc4bb8a81f6f2ab448a918

7) I replace the cookie value with the newly generated hash.
8) I reload the page and successfully obtain the flag.

Flag: spritz{thank_you_for_the_cookie}
