1. I attempt to log in using arbitrary credentials, "admin" and "admin".
2. The content of the page changes, and a message appears prompting me to try again.
3. Inspecting the webpage and analyzing the cookies in the Application section, I notice a permission field with the value "user".
4. My goal is to access the page as an admin, so I attempt to change the value of the cookie to "admin".
5. I reload the page and successfully obtain the flag.
